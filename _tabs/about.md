## Hey there!

I’m a cybersecurity professional with a passion for balancing life both in the digital world and beyond. As much as I thrive on securing networks and systems, there’s nothing quite like stepping away from the screen and spending time outdoors with my wife and three sons, my amazing black lab, and the beautiful Colorado landscape (or anywhere really - I am actually a third generation Floridian!).

I’m all about finding that sweet spot between family and letting the outdoors fuel my work. Whether it’s hiking, primitive camping, or just soaking in the smell of pine trees, I find inspiration in nature that translates into my work which helps me think outside the box and bring fresh perspectives to cybersecurity.

On the professional side, I hold an MS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance and a BS in Information Technology Security. My career has taken me from the fast-paced world of AWS to large ISPs and even the state government, where I’ve had the chance to lead NOC teams, work as a Cloud Engineer, Network Security Engineer, and Cyber Security III. I’ve had hands-on experience securing critical infrastructure, managing network security operations, and protecting systems at scale.

At the end of the day, I’m committed to ensuring that data stays safe and security protocols are rock solid—for the organizations and people I serve. But I also believe that finding joy in the little things, like spending time with my family or feeling the breeze while on a hike, keeps me grounded and motivated.
