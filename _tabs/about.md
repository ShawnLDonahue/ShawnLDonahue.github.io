## Lets dig in.

I’m originally from Fort Myers, Florida. Like many in my generation, the post-9/11 world shaped my sense of purpose early. In 2005, I enlisted in the U.S. Army as an infantryman, driven by a desire to serve and protect.

After my service, I entered the world of information technology through hands-on field work with a major ISP, supporting network infrastructure across Southwest Florida. It was during this time that I met the woman who would later become my wife. We eventually moved to Orlando, where I began building a new kind of career—this time on the operations side of enterprise technology. I found early success working in the NOC of one of the largest ISPs in the country, quickly moving up to a team lead position. That momentum continued when I was promoted to Systems Engineer for Core Operations, a role that required relocating my family to Colorado and marked a significant step forward in both technical depth and leadership.

While balancing full-time work and raising a young family, I completed both a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. From there, I transitioned into the public sector as a Network Security Engineer for the Colorado Judicial Branch, where I focused on protecting critical infrastructure and sensitive systems. Later, I joined Amazon Web Services as a Cloud Support Engineer, working directly with global enterprise clients to secure and optimize their cloud environments.

Today, I serve as a Cybersecurity Analyst, leveraging a deep foundation in network operations, cloud architecture, and security engineering to protect systems at scale and lead effective response efforts. I hold certifications including Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Cisco CCNA Security, CompTIA Security+, Network+, Linux+, and Project+, and I’m an active/certified member of the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC²) chasing my goal of CISSP by 2026.

This work isn’t just a career—it’s a commitment. Every environment I support, every system I harden, and every incident I lead through resolution is part of a broader mission: to bring clarity, integrity, and resilience to the organizations that rely on it.
