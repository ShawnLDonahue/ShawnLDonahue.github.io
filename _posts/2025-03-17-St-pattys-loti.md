## Believe it or not - it matters.

In my time serving the technology world, I have witnessed the transition of security jobs go through several iterations.

Once upon a time it was just 

#### "I.T."

and along the way, someone said "Our systems guys don't want to deal with firewalls"

and so...

#### "I.T. Security"

...was born and is somewhat still in use. 

 THEN purism gave rise to the likes of the following:

#### "Security Analyst"
#### "Security Engineer"
#### "Security Manager"
#### "Security Architect"

For many organizations, these titles work just fine. Solid security generalist titles, expecting a wide range of skills.

And finally here is where we are today, some organizations need a SPECIFIC type of security engineer. 

So now we are getting even more details:

#### "Network Security Analyst"
#### "Cloud Security Engineer"

and even more granular... 

#### "Cisco Network Security Analyst"
#### "AWS Cloud Security Engineer - Firewall and IAM"

Which is great when it comes to finding the right role and avoiding applying to the wrong one. 

The problem arises when companies use:

### IT Security Engineer 

but what they really need, for example, is.. 

### IT Security Engineer, IAM 

Further problems are fed by a lack of outlining this need in the job descriptions. Subtly burying a need for identity management somewhere in the description. 

When specific needs should be upfront, bold, capitalized, with time-in-role years made clear:

"5+ years of direct IAM, AD Experience is a MUST."
or 
"Candidates will have 5+ years of experience directly managing Palo Alto Firewalls"

Imagine sitting for an interview for a generalist role, and they ask repetitive questions about technology not outlined in their job description, job title, and certainly nowhere in your resume. 

It can be cumbersome and a massive waste of everyones time.

#### So, for all of the recruiters and hiring managers out there - try just a little harder. Remember this is out of respect for the candidates and your teams.
Your time is important but not more important.

Hope that helps.
