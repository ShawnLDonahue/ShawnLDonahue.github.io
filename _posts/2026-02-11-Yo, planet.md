## Why This Site Exists

I built this site to document real work, lessons learned, and practical security projects.

Over the past several years, my career has evolved from general IT into focused cybersecurity work; including incident response development, risk assessments, infrastructure hardening, and governance alignment.

Rather than keep that experience siloed inside organizations, this space will serve as a place to:

- Break down projects in a practical way  
- Share implementation details (when appropriate)  
- Reflect on lessons learned  
- Explore security strategy and governance  

## What to Expect

Most posts will be straightforward and technical.  
Some will focus on process and leadership.  
Others will explore architecture decisions and tradeoffs.

No marketing language. No exaggeration. Just practical cybersecurity work and honest reflection.

## What's Next

The next post will dive into a real project including scope, approach, and outcomes.

Thanks for reading
