```bash
The em dash -> â€” FIVE keystrokes,To type an em dash, hold down the Alt key and press 0151 
The hyphen -> -  One keystroke, shared with underscore
```

Now, that's not true for Macs. It's easier but still not easier than a hyphen.

### You probably used AI to write it. Just admit it already. 

The em dash is not as handy as a hyphen on a standard Windows keyboard.

Grammatically speaking, I think most people have been using the hyphen in place of the em dash for decades. 

AI doesn't really like to make grammar mistakes and so it uses em dash quite often.
